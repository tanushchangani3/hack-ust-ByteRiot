Introduction for Interface 1
A React project is used to build up the prototype of the interface. Due to the limitations of file size, only the src folder containing the core codes are uploaded.
The program as a whole could be started with typing the command ‘npm start’ in the terminal (need to set up node js environment first).
## Breakdown
The files used to build up the prototype is stored under src folder(the uploaded folder). The index.js is used to set up a environment, the App.tsx is to indicate the interface, the Sandbox view and the User view, and each music play card is indicated in the musicF.js and is maped by the information in the info.json.
